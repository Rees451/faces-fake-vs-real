# Faces project

## Summary

This project was undertaken as part of the data science immersive course at General Assembly. The aim was to apply computer vision techniques to human faces to detect whether they had been photoshopped or not. The project ended up falling into two parts. The former focussed on implmenting the work outlined in [1] and [2] in segmenting human faces and the second part was concerned with developing a classifier using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection)
