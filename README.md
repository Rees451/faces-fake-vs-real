# Fake vs Real Face Detection
## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project was to develop a classifier to detect fake images of faces. A write up of the methodology used and key results can be found in [this blog post](edward-rees.com/blog).

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Convolutional Neural Networks

### Technologies
* Python
* jupyter
* Tensorflow (incl. Tensorboard)
* Sklearn
