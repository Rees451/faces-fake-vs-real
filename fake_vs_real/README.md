# Fake vs Real Face Detection
This project is a part of the [Data Science Working Group](http://datascience.codeforsanfrancisco.org) at [Code for San Francisco](http://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org).  Other DSWG projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project was to develop a classifier to detect fake images of faces.

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Convolutional Neural Networks

### Technologies
* Python
* jupyter
* Tensorflow
* Sklearn

## Project Description
This project was motivated in part my the rising tide of doctored images and 'deep fake' videos online. 

## Demo

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
